Modern *demography*, the science of enumerating
populations, began with @JGraunt1662 and his realization that London's
mortality bills and christening records could be used as data sources for an
empirical analysis of London's population growth [@DGlass1963]. Graunt's
demographic analysis was geographic, insofar as it dealt with data records from
different parishes, and suggested the role of migration from rural parishes to
London as a reason for the apparent ability of the metropolis to sustain
a higher rate of deaths than births [@CTaeuber1941]. Graunt's work inspired
mathematicians such as Huygens, Leibniz, and Bernoulli in their development of
classical probability theory [@PKreager1993]. But his originality was in the way
he saw the socio-economic and political significance of numbering population
[@ZBayatrizi2008].

The most straightforward way to establish the number of a population is simply
to count it directly. Parliament debated the idea of a national census in 1753,
but the bill did not pass; it was seen as an unprecedented intrusion into
private matters, and some argued it was "subversive of the last remains of
English liberty" [@HRobbins2010,p.202]. However, when the American colonies
became independent, and established themselves as a republican democracy,
a decennial census was made a constitutional requirement; a corallary of the
need "to ensure the civic empowerment of each individual" [@TSullivan2020]. The
first census of the USA was taken in 1790 [@MAnderson2015], and Europe followed
suit shortly thereafter: Britain in 1801 [@DGlass1978; @KLevitan2011], and
France soon afterwards [@JCole2000].

The new era of (nineteenth-century) 'big data', meant @JFletcher1847 could
combine "the last Census of the Population; the Income Tax Returns; the Home
Office Tables of Criminal Offenders; the latest Reports of the Poor Law
Commissioners; and a Summary of Savings Banks" (p.194) to produce a Comparison
of the different Districts of England and Wales, in respect to the Distribution
of the Population, its Social Organization, its Education and Ignorance, its
Providence and Improvidence, and its Crime, in which each county has been
classified "on the evidence of the occupation abstract of 1841, with a further
reference to their geographical contiguity, and the different origin of the
great body of their population". Within each district, counties were also
classed with regards to educational attainment. This sociodemographic analysis
is then visualized by a map of England (and Wales) in which each county in
coloured to show how it has been classified (@Fig:Fletcher_EnglishRegions). Two
years later he expanded the work to included twelve shaded maps for each
variable independently [@HFunkhouser1937], apparently motivated by a comment
from Prince Albert [@HWainer2012].

![England's Manufacturing Districts, after
@JFletcher1847](../figures/JFletcher1847.jpg){#fig:Fletcher_EnglishRegions}

At the smaller scale of the neighbourhood, a Church of England minister in
Liverpool called Abraham Hume [@LVaughan2018, p.62] organized a detailed
door-to-door survey of the social condition of his parishioners [@AHume1850;
@AHume1858], which he presented on a large coloured map [@AHume1858a], showing
simultaneously poverty, crime, health, church and school data on a vertical
plan of the city (@Fig:Hume_LiverpoolMap). Poverty is shown by street,
according to whether the street is classed as 'wholly pauper' or partially so,
as assessed by "the relieving officers within the Borough" (p.21). 

![*Ecclesiastical and Social Map of Liverpool* after
@AHume1858a](../figures/AHume1858Rotated.jpg){#fig:Hume_LiverpoolMap}

Hume is aware that a more precise analysis would be made possible "if we could
compare *houses, families, or individuals* relieved" (p.22), but is content
that "for practical purposes they are sufficiently so now". Still, when
@JTobias1974 applied modern mathematical methods to Hume's data (examining
p-value scores, chi-squared tests and correlation coefficients) he found that
"Hume's impressionistic descriptions have been shown to be consistent with the
data he collected but doubtless never analysed in this way" [p.229]. Hume is
also interested in patterns of residential mobility and their effects on
neighbourhood change; in particular, the way that congregational Nonconformist
churches (in contrast to the territorial Established Church), tend to follow
the paths trod by the middle classes from the centre of a town to the suburbs
[@WPickering1972, p.42; @AWilcox2014, p.12].

Hume's preferred name for the general subject which encompassed all the
particular social sciences within it, was 'Ethnology'. He articulated and
applied his theory of ethnology over the course of several articles in the
nascent *Ulster Journal of Archaeology* [@AHume1853; -@AHume1856; -@AHume1859],
describing and analyzing the counties of Down and Antrim (@Fig:HumeEth). Hume is interested in
Down and Antrim because "the variety of population which these two counties
contain" (p.14) -- specifically, locals of Irish, Scottish, and English
heritage -- means that the relationship between ancestry, language, and
religion can be explored in some detail. In
some ways his articles resemble the generic descriptive regional geographies
that described *The Natural History and Antiquities* of the County of Surrey
[@JAubrey1719], Northumberland [@JWallis1769], or the parish of Selborne
[@GWhite1813]. But although he embraces the old form, he attempts to inject it
with a new scientific rigour, backed with quantitative analysis -- in many ways
anticipating changes to the subject of Geography which would finally emerge on
a wider scale a century later, in the contested 'quantitative revolution' of
the 1950s-70s [@RJohnston2008,pp.52-54]. Indeed, Hume shows himself to be
aware of the complications of spatial resolution for statistical analysis
[@AHorner2010] -- what we now know as the *modifiable areal unit problem* 
[@SOpenshaw1984b].

Although the claim that Charles Booth's maps are the
first example of geodemographic visualization is frequently repeated
[@RHarrisEtAl2005, p.30; @RBurrowsGane2006, p.794; @CDaltonThatcher2015, p.3;
@RWebberBurrows2018, p.31], an investigation of nineteenth-century
cartography shows that Booth's (undeniable) achievement was climactic rather
than conceptual. Typological population mapping in fact preceded Booth by more
than half a century [@LVaughan2018, p.62; @ARobinson1982, p.184]. To
state this takes nothing away from Booth's magisterial survey, which we can now consider in more detail.


Charles Booth was a wealthy Liverpool shipowner and enthusiastic member of the
Royal Statistical Society, which he served for a time as president
[@CBooth1893]. He was also an earnest Unitarian, and felt a sense of
personal responsibility for the wretched conditions of poor labourers
[@CCollet1945]. In 1887, Booth began work on a "proposed inquiry into
the condition and occupations of the people of London" [@CBooth1887],
motivated perhaps by a "desire to prove the Socialists wrong in their
estimate of the extent of poverty in London" [@HPfautz1967, p.21].
@RHarrisEtAl2005 [p.30] follow @HPfautz1967 [p.21] and @TSimeySimey1960
[p.69] in accepting the claim of @HHyndman1911 [p.303] that he was
a causal influence; however @RODayEnglander1992 [p.30-31] disagree,
arguing that althoguh Hyndman's conclusions may have disturbed Booth,
"they certainly did not provide the main impetus for Booth's survey".
Over the next seventeen years, Booth and his research team filled 450
notebooks with information about the capital's living and working
conditions, which were published in three printed editions, the final
running to seventeen volumes [@SDonnelly2002]. Funding for the project
came from the profits of Booth's own commercial success
[@SDonnelly2002]. 

Booth and his team drew on extensive interviews with the house-to-house
visitors employed by the School Board [@CBooth1887], which they combined
with anonymized data from the 1891 Census [@CBooth1893]. This
information then allowed each street block [@LVaughanGeddes2009] to be
allocated to one of his eight levels of deprivation. These in turn were
colour-coded according to their relative level of poverty, with darker
colours representing the poorer residential areas, although the precise
correspondence between class and colour turns out on close inspection to
be somewhat ambiguous [@MKimball2006].

Booth expressed his doubts that he could make his figures "as luminous
and picturesque to any other eye as they are to mine" [@CBooth1904,
p.63), but for some he certainly succeeded. The map (@Fig:BoothMap) received intense
media attention when it was first put on public display [@KBales1999],
and his methodology influenced other reform-minded social researchers,
such as @JAddams1895, @WDuBois1899, and @BRowntree1902.

On the other hand, Booth was sidelined by the academic
institutionalization of sociology, marked in Britain by the appointment
of a first Professor of Sociology in 1904 at the London School of
Economics [@CTopalov1993]. When compared with the strongly theory-driven
work  of continental sociologists such as Durkheim and Weber, Booth's
"uncontrolled empiricism" has been judged to lack "clear objectives and
ideas" and "sociological imagination" [@JWestergaard1969]. Half
a century later, @TSimeySimey1960 attempted to position Booth as the
founding father of British sociology, but this was arguably driven
primarily by a desire to locate a respectable pedigree for their subject
[@RODayEnglander1992]. The claim that Booth invented the concept of 'the
poverty line' [@TSimeySimey1960, p.88] also fails under scrutiny;
@AGillie1996 shows that it must rather have come directly from the
London School Board, whose home-visitation workers supplied Booth's
project with information about families' living conditions, and which
was required by the implications of the 1870 Education Act to develop
a criterion of poverty.

Booth's statistical enthusiasm also lacked mathematical expertise
[@HSelvin1976]. The physicist @GYule1895 was provoked "to severely
criticize the [statistical] methods on which he bases his results"
(p.608), showing repeatedly (Yule gives sixteen specific examples) that
Booth claims his figures show no definite relation, when in fact
a strong numerical correlation is present. 

It is also worth noting explicitly that while Booth's research was
multivariate in its input [@WDavies1978], its output was not a true
multidimensional classification of different *types* of residential
neighbourhood, but rather a unidimensional index of poverty separated
into quantiles. In that respect it is more similar to the
modern Index of Multiple Deprivation [@IDeasEtAl2003] than a modern
geodemographic classification. This meant that Booth's analysis was
ill-equipped to deal with communities differentiated by factors other
than merely economic, and it is thus unsurprising that he struggled to
fit Jewish immigrants into his schema [@DEnglander1989].

However, though Booth may have been sidelined by the development of
academic sociology in Britain, his style of detailed social survey had
somewhat more influence on its development in America, particularly
through the Chicago School.

## The Chicago School

The phrase 'Chicago School' implies an institution, a group of people,
a body of work, a set of ideas -- and a period of time during which
those entities were, if not isomorphic, then at least functionally
equivalent. The reality of such an equivalence has been critically
deconstructed by @LHarvey1987 and @ACortese1995. In fact, the phrase
seems to have first been used by @LBernard1930 as a way of dismissing
the 'Park Chicago School' for being in his view too much a personal
following of Robert Park, rather than having "science as the central
interest" (p.133), and being inclined "to regard case studies as
superior to statistical studies" (p.127). Nevertheless, @AAbbott2017a
argues, after a comprehensive historiographical survey, that the
enduring interest in and quantity of writing on the 'Chicago School' at
least "suggests that there was, in fact, something real behind the
phrase".

The institution, the University of Chicago's Department of Sociology was
established in 1892. It was the first separate university department
focused on the subject, at a time when American universities were
transitioning to being primarily focused on research rather than merely
teaching [@JTurner1988]. It was initially headed by Albion Small, who
founded the *American Journal of Sociology*, and in his opening paper
[-@ASmall1895a] is at pains to distinguish the scientific understanding
"of associated human activites as a whole" which the Journal hopes to
promote, from the "palliatives" of social reformers.

Though founded by Albion Small, it is Robert Park who is generally
credited with shaping the distinctive urban emphasis of the University
of Chicago's Department of Sociology. Park was already fifty years old
when he joined the faculty of Chicago in 1914, having worked previously
as a journalist [@RLindner1996], and as an assistant to the Black
American spokesman Booker T. Washington [@SFenton1981]. A year later
@RPark1915 published the first version of an article that would later be
reprinted as the first chapter of a collective volume by members of the
Chicago School defining their vision for research into *The City*
[@RParkEtAl1925]. 

@RPark1925 begins by considering 'The City Plan', but in his account
urban planning turns out to be largely a backdrop for more specifically
social processes. Although a city plan may impose a certain order upon
the built environment of the city, Park is primarily interested in "the
inevitable processes" of personal tastes, vocational and economic
interests, which tend to segregate the population of a city [cf.
@TSchelling1969]. Thus over time "every section and quarter of the city
takes on something of the character and qualities of its inhabitants",
transforming "what was at first a mere geographical expression into
a neighborhood" (p.6). 

He then turns to 'The Neighborhood' specifically, that "simplest and
most elementary form" of urban society, based on "proximity and
neighborly contact" (p.7). While for some areas, "the easy means of
communication and transportation" of modern urban life "tend to destroy
the permanancy and intimacy of the neighborhood", it can equally be the
case, particularly "where there is racial prejudice", that population
segregation can intensify the "intimacies and solidarity" of the local
neighbourhood group (p.9).

![Community Areas of Chicago in
1930](../figures/ChicagoCommunityAreas.png){#fig:ChicagoCommunity}

The volume includes E. Burgess's famous Concentric Zone diagram
(@Fig:BurgessDiagrams), an essay by R. McKenzie explaining the Chicago
School's distinctive 'The Ecological Approach', and a comprehensive
bibliography (credited to Louis Wirth) (in which Booth's *Life and
Labour...* is highlighted as "Especially interesting... for its
description of the natural areas of [London]"). But more than half of
the chapters come from Park, and it is clear that the questions of his
'Suggestions' for investigating modern urban society drive the book.
Indeed, a century on, they remain fresh and stimulating; @AKarvonen2020
calls it "essential reading... because it establishes a research agenda
that continues to be an inspiration".

While Burgess' Concentric Zone model has remained the dominant visual
image of the Chicago School's urban research, closer investigation shows
that this diagram, based on the theory of the German agricultural
economist @JVonThunen1826, actually had limited substantive influence,
as they moved towards more empirically grounded ecological maps and
census tract maps [@BOwens2012] -- for example, see
@Fig:ChicagoCommunity. 

## Quantitative Social Area Analysis

The American Census Bureau first reported statistics by tract for the
1920 census [@DFoley1953], beginning with ten cities and expanding by
the 1950s to seventy-two. The first census tract maps were produced (for
Chicago) by @EBurgessNewcomb1931, and a few years later (for St Louis)
by @RFletcherEtAl1935. @EKnaapEtAl2019 note that census data meant that
"social processes, which are difficult to observe [using social survey
methods], could be treated as latent variables and modeled... easily".

![*Social Area Analysis* of the San Francisco Bay Region, after @EShevkyBell1955](../figures/ShevkyBell1955.png){#fig:ShevkyBell_SanFrancisco}

It was Eshref Shevky and his associates who developed a more
sophisticated multivariate analysis of census tract data, reducing the
dimensionality of the data to the three *factors* of 'social rank',
'urbanization', and 'segregation'. This was done first for Los Angeles
[@EShevkyWilliams1949a], and then San Franciso [@WBell1953,
@Fig:ShevkyBell_SanFrancisco], before being advocated more broadly as
a method of analyis with general applicability to the social analysis of
American cities [@EShevkyBell1955]. Having calculated the score of each
census tract with regards to the three theoretically fundamental
factors, the tract could be grouped together with others with similar
configurations of scores. Shevky's method was debated and developed
[@PNewtonJohnston1976] in various more open-ended directions and
deployed in a number of diverse contexts [@PRees1971]. Of particular
interest was the claim that the principle components to which they had
reduced their data were the fundamental factors differentiating the
residential groups of modern society [@DTimms1971].

## Modern Geodemographics in the Peer-Reviewed Literature

As has been described above, the word 'geodemographics' was coined by 
@JRobbin1980. By that time, Robbin had long since dropped out of his PhD, 
after his supervisor left to take up a post at another university [@Ricercar2021].
Geodemographics was therefore, for him, a commercial asset which needed
on the one hand, to be kept strategically obscure, and on the other hand, to be
confidently advertised with all the necessary hype. In Robbin's own words, it
needed to be perceived as "the new magic" [@JRobbin1980] -- a phrase which
suggests both a mystical secrecy (in contrast to the transparent clarity for
which science should aim), and impressive effectiveness. One consequence of
this is that while Robbin's venture was a commercial success, he never
published anything in the peer-reviewed scholarly literature [although
@Ricercar2021a gives a list of more than twenty papers presented at scholarly
conferences]. One exception to this general lack of literature, is a report
made for the American military, and now approved for public release, in which
@JDeReuRobbin1981 explain the application of geodemographics to the army
recruiting problem. In the document the techniques used in creating 'the
Claritas Cluster System': principle component analysis to reduce the
dimensionality of the census data, followed by k-means cluster analysis to
create a neighbourhood typology. Interestingly, the clustering analysis is
applied not on the 230,000 'block-groups' for which census data was given, but
at the lower resolution of (the 37,000) five-digit ZIP codes, presumably
because computational power at the time was insufficient to handle the larger
number of data points.

Independently in the UK, Richard Webber [-@RWebber1975, -@RWebber1977, -@RWebber1978]
was similarly applying cluster analysis to census data; in his case, for the
purpose of helping the Liverpool City Council identify priority areas for
social service provision. Perhaps since he was working for a public authority,
or perhaps just by personal proclivity, Webber's research has been released
much more publicly, and he has been a co-author of the major monographs on the
subject [@RHarrisEtAl2005; @RWebberBurrows2018]. Thus, while in North America,
it has been the case that "many academic social scientists ignore
geodemographics" [@MReibel2011, p.310], this is not true in Britain. In
Britain, geodemographics has been the subject of a fairly steady stream of
scholarship over the last forty years. Some of this has admittedly had
a promotional undertone, with the impression given that, for example,
@PSleightLeventhal1989 are less interested in critically assessing the
application of geodemographics to marketing, than in marketing their
geodemographic research to future clients. But there have also been forthright
debates, with opposing viewpoints clearly and thoroughly articulated. 

@SOpenshawGillard1978 investigated the stability of neighbourhood
classifications and demonstrated that there were multiple points in the process
where different (but still justifiable) decisions could lead to quite different
results: the selection of variables, the choice of algorithm and subsequent
functional parameters, the implementation and method of normalization or
dimension reduction; they concluded therefore that such classifications --
naming explicitly @RWebber1975 -- "should not be used" (p.119). Webber
apparently was unaware of the critique, but when @SOpenshawEtAl1980 repeated
the judgment, @RWebber1980 briskly responded with a detailed rebuttal
concluding that the critics were not "in touch with either public policy or the
commercial world" (p.449).  Presumably, the point was well taken, as
@SOpenshaw1985 then applied census-data cluster classification to rural areas,
complaining of the resistance of government departments to such methods, and of
their "preference for old fashioned pre-computer age techniques" (p.286).
In my view, the solution to the question raised by this controversy is to
distinguish clearly -- as I have suggested earlier in this essay -- between
a (boundary-based) *classification* and an (exemplar-focused) *typology*.

@SOpenshaw1997 then found himself in another significant controversy concerning 
geodemographics, this time offering a defense, in the context of
a more widely-ranging response to the various criticisms of Geographic Information
Systems gathered by @JPickles1995. Specifically, Openshaw responded to the 
portrayal given by @JCrampton1995 and @JGoss1995 of geodemographics as a 
terrifying tool of mass surveillance, able to manipulate and control customer
behaviour. Concerns which seemed disproportionate and even absurd in the
early years of Internet usage -- Amazon.com was only launched in July 1995 
[@JChevalierGoolsbee2003] -- now seem much more relevant, and altogether more
plausible. Aspects of Openshaw's argument merely dodges the issue,
acknowledging for example "the much more all embracing and threatening" 'IT',
but distinguishing it from 'GIS'; saying that a comprehensive customer database
need not be feared since it "does not *yet* [emphasis added] exist". The point
which stands out as having the most continued validity in his discussion is
his suggestion that "data protection legislation" can mitigate some of the dangers of 
unfettered technological surveillance. Robust data protection legislation does
now exist [@GDPR2016; @PPrescott2020b], and indeed, the geodemographics giant
Experian has been found to be in breach [@ICO2020a]. @DSwanlundSchuurman2019
suggest a variety of strategies and tactics for resisting *geosurveillance*.
