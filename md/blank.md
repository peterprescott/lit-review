This paper presents a comprehensive review of the background
literature necessary to understand the current state of geodemographic
research, to identify unresolved questions and issues requiring further
study, and to develop an agenda of priorities for this doctoral thesis.

First, we set geodemographics within the broader contemporary context of
data science. Next, we introduce geodemographics itself, offering a
definition, a description, and an initial overview of its development.
We then review the historical antecedents of geodemographic analysis in
more detail: the groundbreaking visualizations of nineteenth-century
urban thematic mapping; the rich investigative agenda of the early
Chicago School's human ecology; and the quantitative developments of
social area analysis and factorial ecology.  From there, we examine the
subsequent critiques and controversies that have been provoked by
geodemographics, finding two principal components in the dicussion which
continue to generate heated debate: the ethical dimension of social
surveillance on the one hand, and the ontological dimension of
neighbourhood definition on the other.  Consideration of the first leads
us to appreciate the importance of free and open source geodemographic
classifications, which have now become well-estalished; consideration of
the second leads us to a survey of the intrinsic problems of spatial
zone design in quantitative geography, a review of the progress in
addressing those problems, and a deeper investigation into studies of
neighbourhood dynamics and ontology. Finally, we review developments in
the techniques of *areal interpolation*, the transformation of a dataset
from the original geographic partition with which the data is associated
to some alternative set of areal boundaries. We conclude by summarizing
the specific research goals resulting from our review of the
literature.

# The Contemporary Context: Big Data, Machine Learning, and Scientific Theory

*Data science*, *big data*, and *machine
learning*, showing that contrary to some hype-driven claims, such
developments in fact make domain-knowledge and interpretable theory more
important, not less. Since real-world events all take place in physical
space, this means that *geographic* theory has much to offer
