In this section, we describe the emergence of a confluence
of digital phenomena that seem to be catalyzing a paradigm shift [@Kuhn]
not so much in any one arena of academic enquiry as across the broader
field of scientific discovery [@THeyEtAl2009]. The availability of
unprecedented quantities of *Big Data*, the accessibile abundance of
on-demand *Cloud* computation, and the success of sophisticated *Machine
Learning* algorithms, have led to the *Data Science* advocated fifty
years ago by @JTukey1962 to finally emerge as a clear and present need.
An investigation of the usage of these terms on Google [@Fig1],
demonstrates their recent rise, and also suggests a possible chain of causal
dependece: the capture and storage of data being enabled and accelerated by
the connectedness of every-increasing numbers of computing devices; and
both in turn fuelling the development of and demand for automatic
algorithmic methods for classifying and utilizing all this data, and for
human understanding of its intricacies and implications.

At the turn of the twenty-first century, @DLaney2001 memorably
characterised the key challenge of data management as being
its explosion in "volume, velocity and variety". Whether it was
described as an 'explosion', a 'deluge' [@CAnderson2008], an 'avalanche'
[@HMiller2010], a 'revolution' [@RKitchin2014], or (more abstractly) 'a
zeroth order discontinuity in human affairs' [@DDonoho2017], the
metaphors make clear the size and speed of this sometimes overwhelming
shift. The challenge of responding to this had led to the development of
a series of new technologies: the *MapReduce* pardigm for distributed
data processing [@DeanGhemawat2008], the *Hadoop* Distributed File
System for storing and streaming such data [@ShvachkoEtAl2010], the
*Spark* Resilient Distributed Dataset [@ZahariaEtAl2012] and subsequent
*Dataframe* API [@ArmbrustEtAl2015] for in-memory cluster computing.
