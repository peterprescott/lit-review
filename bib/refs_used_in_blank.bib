                   and because it had not been done yet'', they say. But
                   the dataset accumulated since December 1998 has

                   over half a million dollar bills shows that human

                   Washington, DC. The spatial sciences have recently
                   seen growing calls for more accessible software and
                   tools that better embody geographic science and
                   theory. Urban spatial network science offers one
                   clear opportunity: from multiple perspectives, tools
                   to model and analyze non-planar urban spatial
                   networks have traditionally been inaccessible,
                   atheoretical, or otherwise limiting. This article
                   reflects on this state of the field. Then it
                   discusses the motivation, experience, and outcomes of
                   developing OSMnx, a tool intended to help address
                   this. Next it reviews this tool's use in the recent
                   multidisciplinary spatial network science literature
                   to highlight upstream and downstream benefits of
                   open-source software development. Tool-building is an
                   essential but poorly incentivized component of
                   academic geography and social science more broadly.
                   To conduct better science, we need to build better
                   tools. The article concludes with paths forward,
                   emphasizing open-source software and reusable
                   computational data science beyond mere
                   reproducibility and replicability.},

                   amounts of data about individuals. Here we survey
                   three tactics and three strategies for resistance in
                   an attempt to provoke greater discussion about
                   resistance to geosurveillance. Tactics explored
                   include data minimization, obfuscation, and
                   manipulation. Strategies for resisting
                   geosurveillance build upon other forms of resistance
                   and include examination of the assumptions of
                   geosurveillance, investigating privacy-focused
                   software alternatives, and strengthening the ability
                   of activists to operate in this sphere. Individually,

                   national statistical organisations define small areas
                   termed `building blocks' which are then aggregated
                   into larger `output zones' for data release. While
                   output zones are known to have enormous influence on
                   spatial analysis, there has not been any systematic
                   analysis of the effect of building blocks on
                   characteristics of output zones. This paper evaluates
                   current international practice in building block
                   design, identifying key conceptual and practical
                   issues. Using the example of six local authorities in
                   England and Wales, it employs automated zone design
                   to evaluate the influence of two sets of building
                   blocks (street blocks and postcodes) on output zone
                   characteristics. Household-level census data,
                   accessed under secure conditions, are used to
                   evaluate the impact on both newly designed and
                   maintained output zones. Postcodes are shown to be
                   more effective building blocks than street blocks,
                   providing more uniform population and household
                   sizes, greater precision for matching postcoded data
                   to census data, and enabling more zones to be
                   maintained. However, street blocks deliver more
                   compact output zones and greater internal homogeneity
                   of tenure and accommodation type. The scale effect of
                   the modifiable areal unit problem and the specific
                   geographical patterning of variables are both shown
                   to be important factors when designing building
                   blocks. These findings have directly informed
                   policies and processes for the 2011 Census in England
                   and Wales and provide useful conceptual and practical
                   guidance for any national statistical organisation or
                   analyst designing their own building blocks. The
                   paper concludes that some aspects of international
                   building block design practice could be more
                   effectively harmonised but that such design should
                   always be nationally specific to incorporate locally
                   varying conceptual and practical issues. Further
                   research should extend this analysis to other
                   building block types, notably grid squares.},

                   significant academic attention. This article unpacks
                   what constitutes the Scouse identity, how it is
                   constructed and its different dimensions, with
                   particular reference to place, phonology and race.
                   Its novelty lies in developing the underused concept
                   of ``sonic geography'' to examine the extent to which
                   sound, for example a distinctive accent and/or
                   dialect, affects the construction of local identity.
                   Empirically this is conducted through a detailed
                   analysis of the Scouse, or Liverpudlian, identity.
                   The article also deploys the concept of ``sonic
                   exclusion'' to examine the role a distinguishing

                   poverty' Charles Booth said he used, in the late
                   1880s, to divide the people of London into those 'in
                   poverty' and those 'in comfort'. The poverty lines
                   adopted by school boards, to determine criteria of
                   eligibility for the remission of school fees under
                   the provisions of the 1870 Elementary Education Act,
                   have been forgotten. Yet there are good reasons to
                   suppose that the London School Board's confidential
                   and now rediscovered criteria were used by Booth to
                   define his own 'line of poverty'. This revision of
                   the history of the poverty line throws new light on
                   the development of a fundamental concept in the
                   social sciences, and on the measurement of poverty in
                   the nineteenth century.},

                   so dominated sociology in the 1920s and 1930s, it
                   created the mold or template on which new
                   departments, or the expansion of older ones, were
                   modeled in the 1930s and in the post-World War II
                   period. The legacy of this situation is mixed: On the
                   one hand, the Chicago department made sociology a
                   legitimate discipline in a hostile academic
                   environment, whereas, on the other hand, it helped
                   create a discipline so diversified in substantive
                   specialties, so atheoretical, and so concerned with
                   narrow research and quantitative methods that serious
                   problems of intellectual and organizational
                   integration confront contemporary American

                   OAC) is a new open geodemographic classification of
                   the UK based on 2011 UK Census data. The 2011 OAC,
                   created in partnership with the Office for National
                   Statistics (ONS), supersedes the 2001 Area
                   Classification for Output Areas (2001 OAC) to provide
                   the most current open geodemographic view of the UK.
                   The 2001 OAC was widely used in academia, local
                   government and by commercial organisations, but its
                   reliance on data from the 2001 UK Census has led to a
                   perceived degradation of reliability over time and a
                   decline in users. The release of the 2011 UK Census
                   data provided the opportunity to create a 2011 OAC
                   which could address some of the acknowledged flaws of
                   the 2001 OAC, such as the methods used for data
                   handling, to create a more robust methodology. The
                   publication of this methodology with accompanying
                   documentation, in addition to utilising open-source
                   software, guarantees the reproducibility of the 2011
                   OAC; with an additional benefit of the methodology
                   being able to act as a template for future bespoke
                   open geodemographic classifications. Open
                   geodemographic classifications, unlike those provided
                   by commercial organisations, have historically been
                   unable to utilise ancillary data sources to enrich
                   and update their systems. This research proposes an
                   alternative approach; utilising the limited range of
                   Open Data sources made available regularly at the
                   small granular level to create uncertainty
                   indicators. These indicators allow areas of
                   uncertainty that develop over time within the
                   classification's geodemographic assignment to be
                   identified; allowing users the opportunity to take
                   compensatory action. This project delivered a new
                   open geodemographic classification of the UK. The
                   methodological advances, use of open source software
                   and ability to assess the temporal stability of
                   geodemographic assignments mean the 2011 OAC can be
                   considered a step forward for open geodemographics.},

  abstract =      {Olfaction is involved in various human social
                   interactions, ranging from mother-offspring
                   attachment to mate choice; as in other species, such
                   chemical \-signalling is thought to be shaped by
                   evolution. However, across many human \-cultures,
                   individuals manipulate their body odour by means of
                   various fragrances and these may significantly affect
                   the outcome of social encounters in a
                   context-specific fashion. Here we employ the
                   framework of dual-inheritance theory, which advocates
                   that cultural practices should be incorporated into
                   the analysis of \-evolution of human behaviour, to
                   explore cultural means of olfactory signalling such
                   as ethnic and status markers. Further, we review
                   studies showing that perfumes interact with body
                   odour in an individual fashion and that people tend
                   to choose perfumes according to their genetic
                   make-up. This indicates that biologically evolved
                   chemical \-signalling might operate in concert with
                   cultural human practices. Finally, we propose two
                   scenarios: (1) how culturally based preferences and
                   use of perfume might impact gene frequencies in
                   individual populations, and (2) how evolved cognitive
                   biases might affect selection of scents that are
                   appropriate for body adornments. This, in our view,
                   makes the perfume-body odour complex a potentially
                   insightful model for culture\textendash gene

                   in-depth study of fashion economies from a

                   own, love and desire, and their geographic and
                   economic ties. How far does a garment physically
                   travel from factory to wardrobe? How do clothes come
                   to have social or economic value and who or what
                   creates it? What are the geographies of fashion and

                   trying to model the effects of scale and aggregation,
                   the problem is inverted. An attempt is made to
                   identify a set of zones which optimizes an objective
                   function related in some way to the performance of a

                   Sociology, Andrew Abbott investigates central topics
                   in the emergence of modern scholarship, paying
                   special attention to "schools of science" and how
                   such schools reproduce themselves over time. What are
                   the preconditions from which schools arise? Do they
                   exist as rigid rules or as flexible structures? How
                   do they emerge from the day-to-day activities of
                   academic life such as editing journals and writing
                   papers? Abbott analyzes the shifts in social
                   scientific inquiry and discloses the intellectual
                   rivalry and faculty politics that characterized
                   different stages of the Chicago School. Along the
                   way, he traces the rich history of the discipline's
                   main journal, the American Journal of Sociology.
                   Embedded in this analysis of the school and its
                   practices is a broader theoretical argument, which
                   Abbott uses to redefine social objects as a sequence
                   of interconnected events rather than as fixed
                   entities. Abbott's theories grow directly out of the
                   Chicago School's insistence that social life be
                   located in time and place, a tradition that has been
                   at the heart of the school since its founding one
                   hundred years ago.},

  abstract =      {How can you leverage the value of your company's
                   data? Well over a century ago oil drove the
                   development of innovations such as the internal
                   combustion engine, central heating and plastics,
                   changing our world and our economy. Oil, as a
                   technology, fueled an economic force that inexorably
                   changed the way people lived and worked. Today, data
                   is fueling a very similar change: it is the driving
                   force for new business models and disruptive
                   technologies that impact companies in every
                   imaginable industry. The New Oil shows how data
                   changes the traditional business paradigm. How it
                   impacts not just high-tech, high-profile companies,
                   but also old-school, low-tech industries all around
                   the world; data lives and breathes within every
                   single company. In The New Oil, Arent van `t Spijker
                   explains how companies such as Google, Nike and Adara
                   are leveraging a `Data Driven Strategy'. Many other
                   examples highlight the applications and commercial
                   potential for data. Van \&\#39;t Spijker describes
                   five typical business models for monetizing data that
                   help you to develop viable business models for
                   leveraging data in your own company. He then shows
                   how to successfully put these business models to
                   practice. Above all, he will inspire you to follow in
                   the footsteps of market leaders.},

                   is a sociological study of the blacks living in
                   Philadelphia in 1896-7. DuBois was hired by the
                   University of Pennsylvania to conduct the study,
                   under what some believe to be false pretenses. Some
                   suspect that the study was meant, by those funding
                   it, to show how the black community was responsible
                   for a number of problems within the city. The report
                   they received, however, was of quite a different
                   nature. The Philadelphia Negro was the first
                   sociological study of black urban Americans ever
                   conducted. It detailed their lives, their social
                   structures, their education, their marriages, and
                   their jobs. The study sought to illuminate ways in
                   which philanthropy could help the people living in
                   Philadelphia's Seventh Ward. It did not presume, as
                   many people did at the time, that blacks lived in
                   poor conditions due to an innate weakness in their
                   race. This scholarly work serves as an excellent
                   reference for students of history and sociology.

                   Victorian life that it is impossible to understand
                   this era without some reference to it. Yet the
                   question, which worried the Victorians, still
                   remains, how religious was the mass of Victorian
                   society? Recent scholarship has challenged the
                   orthodoxy that the working classes, and the working
                   classes of large urban centres in particular, were
                   irreligious. Yet Liverpool, with its large migratory
                   population, including Roman Catholics from Ireland
                   and Nonconformists from Wales and Scotland, appeared
                   to offer unpromising ground for the Anglican Church
                   to sow its seed. Within the city, Liverpool's
                   notorious slums seemed to offer the most barren
                   ground of all. What strategies did the Anglican
                   clergy employ to make their churches work at a
                   grassroots level? How could they overcome the
                   problems they faced, which ranged from the hostility
                   of the local community to severe financial
                   constraints? How helpful was the advice dispensed by
                   Church handbooks in dealing with these challenges?
                   More important, is it now possible to estimate the
                   success in gaining not only worshippers, but a wider
                   penumbra of working class adherents to church-based
                   activities?Some of Liverpool's more aristocratic
                   churches were overwhelmed by the encroaching city
                   slums, and the reaction of at least one clergyman was
                   to retreat within his vicarage, and `shut up shop'.
                   However, other clergy set about energetically working
                   the slums. Largely Oxbridge men, with a very
                   different background in social and educational terms
                   to their flock, they made surprising progress. By
                   drawing upon a variety of local sources, including
                   many hitherto unused, this book contends that it is
                   possible to evaluate the success of the Anglican
                   Church in the slums. The Church had successes not
                   only to be judged solely by the number of working
                   class worshippers, but also by the uses the local
                   community made of rites of passage, philanthropic
                   activities and the clubs and societies offered by the
                   Anglican Church in Liverpool.This book is aimed at
                   readers interested in researching family and local

                   techniques to quantify deprivation, there remain

                   organizing principles or they may evolve organically
                   through accretion, but their configurations and
                   orientations help define a city's spatial logic and
                   order. Measures of entropy reveal a city's streets'
                   order and disorder. Past studies have explored
                   individual cases of orientation and entropy, but
                   little is known about broader patterns and trends
                   worldwide. This study examines street network
                   orientation, configuration, and entropy in 100 cities
                   around the world using OpenStreetMap data and OSMnx.
                   It measures the entropy of street bearings in
                   weighted and unweighted network models, along with
                   each city's typical street segment length, average
                   circuity, average node degree, and the network's
                   proportions of four-way intersections and dead-ends.
                   It also develops a new indicator of orientation-order
                   that quantifies how a city's street network follows
                   the geometric ordering logic of a single grid. A
                   cluster analysis is performed to explore similarities
                   and differences among these study sites in multiple
                   dimensions. Significant statistical relationships
                   exist between city orientation-order and other
                   indicators of spatial order, including street
                   circuity and measures of connectedness. On average,
                   US/Canadian study sites are far more grid-like than
                   those elsewhere, exhibiting less entropy and
                   circuity. These indicators, taken in concert, help
                   reveal the extent and nuance of the grid. These
                   methods demonstrate automatic, scalable, reproducible
                   tools to empirically measure and visualize city
                   spatial order, illustrating complex urban
                   transportation system patterns and configurations

  abstract =      {The street network is an important aspect of cities
                   and contains crucial information about their
                   organization and evolution. Characterizing and
                   comparing various street networks could then be
                   helpful for a better understanding of the mechanisms
                   governing the formation and evolution of these
                   systems. Their characterization is however not easy:
                   there are no simple tools to classify planar networks
                   and most of the measures developed for complex
                   networks are not useful when space is relevant. Here,
                   we describe recent efforts in this direction and new
                   methods adapted to spatial networks. We will first
                   discuss measures based on the structure of shortest
                   paths, among which the betweenness centrality. In
                   particular for time-evolving road networks, we will
                   show that the spatial distribution of the betweenness
                   centrality is able to reveal the impact of important
                   structural transformations. Shortest paths are
                   however not the only relevant ones. In particular,
                   they can be very different from those with the
                   smallest number of turns?the simplest paths. The
                   statistical comparison of the lengths of the shortest
                   and simplest paths provides a nontrivial and nonlocal
                   information about the spatial organization of planar
                   graphs. We define the simplicity index as the average
                   ratio of these lengths and the simplicity profile
                   characterizes the simplicity at different scales.
                   Measuring these quantities on artificial (roads,
                   highways, railways) and natural networks (leaves,
                   insect wings) show that there are fundamental
                   differences?probably related to their different
                   function?in the organization of urban and biological
                   systems: there is a clear hierarchy of the lengths of
                   straight lines in biological cases, but they are
                   randomly distributed in urban systems. The paths are
                   however not enough to fully characterize the spatial
                   pattern of planar networks such as streets and roads.
                   Another promising direction is to analyze the
                   statistics of blocks of the planar network. More
                   precisely, we can use the conditional probability
                   distribution of the shape factor of blocks with a
                   given area, and define what could constitute the
                   fingerprint of a city. These fingerprints can then
                   serve as a basis for a classification of cities based
                   on their street patterns. This method applied on more
                   than 130 cities in the world leads to four broad
                   families of cities characterized by different
                   abundances of blocks of a certain area and shape.
                   This classification will be helpful for identifying
                   dominant mechanisms governing the formation and
                   evolution of street patterns.},

                   together in some neighborhoods and not in others?
                   From the Ground Up argues that neighborhood
                   communities emerge from neighbor networks, and shows
                   that these social relations are unique because of
                   particular geographic qualities. Highlighting the
                   linked importance of geography and children to the
                   emergence of neighborhood communities, Rick Grannis
                   models how neighboring progresses through four
                   stages: when geography allows individuals to be
                   conveniently available to one another; when they have
                   passive contacts or unintentional encounters; when
                   they actually initiate contact; and when they engage
                   in activities indicating trust or shared norms and
                   values. Seamlessly integrating discussions of
                   geography, household characteristics, and lifestyle,
                   Grannis demonstrates that neighborhood communities
                   exhibit dynamic processes throughout the different
                   stages. He examines the households that relocate in
                   order to choose their neighbors, the choices of
                   interactions that develop, and the exchange of
                   beliefs and influence that impact neighborhood
                   communities over time. Grannis also introduces and
                   explores two geographic concepts\textendash
                   t-communities and street islands\textendash to
                   capture the subtle features constraining residents'
                   perceptions of their environment and community.

                   Sociology, Andrew Abbott investigates central topics
                   in the emergence of modern scholarship, paying
                   special attention to "schools of science" and how
                   such schools reproduce themselves over time. What are
                   the preconditions from which schools arise? Do they
                   exist as rigid rules or as flexible structures? How
                   do they emerge from the day-to-day activities of
                   academic life such as editing journals and writing
                   papers? Abbott analyzes the shifts in social
                   scientific inquiry and discloses the intellectual
                   rivalry and faculty politics that characterized
                   different stages of the Chicago School. Along the
                   way, he traces the rich history of the discipline's
                   main journal, the American Journal of Sociology.
                   Embedded in this analysis of the school and its
                   practices is a broader theoretical argument, which
                   Abbott uses to redefine social objects as a sequence
                   of interconnected events rather than as fixed
                   entities. Abbott's theories grow directly out of the
                   Chicago School's insistence that social life be
                   located in time and place, a tradition that has been
                   at the heart of the school since its founding one
                   hundred years ago.},

                   that can potentially involve three factors:
                   homophily, or the formation of social ties due to
                   matching individual traits; social contagion, also
                   known as social influence; and the causal effect of
                   an individual's covariates on his or her behavior or
                   other measurable responses. The authors show that
                   generically, all of these are confounded with each
                   other. Distinguishing them from one another requires
                   strong assumptions on the parametrization of the
                   social process or on the adequacy of the covariates
                   used (or both). In particular the authors
                   demonstrate, with simple examples, that asymmetries
                   in regression coefficients cannot identify causal
                   effects and that very simple models of imitation (a
                   form of social contagion) can produce substantial
                   correlations between an individual's enduring traits
                   and his or her choices, even when there is no
                   intrinsic affinity between them. The authors also

                   groups on the basis of the type of postcode in which
                   we live. Social scientists call this practice
                   commercial sociology . Richard Webber originated
                   Acorn and Mosaic, the two most successful

                   critical interdisciplinary social scientist. Together

                   around ?Big Data?, tend to be presented as new and
                   innovative, emerging ahistorically to revolutionize
                   modern life. In this article, we situate one branch
                   of Big Data analytics, spatial Big Data, through a
                   historical predecessor, geodemographic analysis, to
                   help develop a critical approach to current data
                   analytics. Spatial Big Data promises an epistemic
                   break in marketing, a leap from targeting
                   geodemographic areas to targeting individuals. Yet it
                   inherits characteristics and problems from
                   geodemographics, including a justification through
                   the market, and a process of commodification through
                   the black-boxing of technology. As researchers
                   develop sustained critiques of data analytics and its
                   effects on everyday life, we must so with a grounding
                   in the cultural and historical contexts from which
                   data technologies emerged. This article and others
                   (Barnes and Wilson, 2014) develop a historically
                   situated, critical approach to spatial Big Data. This
                   history illustrates connections to the critical
                   issues of surveillance, redlining, and the production
                   of consumer subjects and geographies. The shared
                   histories and structural logics of spatial Big Data
                   and geodemographics create the space for a continued

                   type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice,
                   support, information transfer, exchange,
                   comembership, and other types of relationship. The
                   result is that people's personal networks are
                   homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic,
                   behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics.
                   Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that
                   has powerful implications for the information they
                   receive, the attitudes they form, and the
                   interactions they experience. Homophily in race and
                   ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our
                   personal environments, with age, religion, education,
                   occupation, and gender following in roughly that
                   order. Geographic propinquity, families,
                   organizations, and isomorphic positions in social
                   systems all create contexts in which homophilous
                   relations form. Ties between nonsimilar individuals
                   also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage
                   for the formation of niches (localized positions)
                   within social space. We argue for more research on:
                   (a) the basic ecological processes that link
                   organizations, associations, cultural communities,
                   social movements, and many other social forms; (b)
                   the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of
                   homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change
                   over time through which networks and other social
                   entities co-evolve.},

                   Statistical O ces when publishing the results of
                   decennial censuses for small geographical areas. If
                   they publish statistical tables for two or more sets
                   of areas, users can compare the tables and produce
                   new statistics for the areas formed by di erencing,
                   which may have populations below con\textregistered{}
                   dentiality thresholds. To investigate the problem,
                   the authors construct a software system and carry out
                   a series of experiments using a large synthetic
                   population base for Yorkshire and Humberside. The
                   results indicate that publishing statistics for zones
                   close in size to the primary areas is not safe unless
                   the zones have been carefully designed. However,

                   as 5 km grid squares or postal sectors alongside

                   zoning map of early twentieth-century Asmara, to a
                   map of wealth disparities in the banlieues of

                   the evolution of social cartography over the past two
                   centuries. In this richly illustrated book, Laura
                   Vaughan examines maps of ethnic or religious
                   difference, poverty, and health inequalities,
                   demonstrating how they not only serve as historical
                   records of social enquiry, but also constitute
                   inscriptions of social patterns that have been etched
                   deeply on the surface of cities. The book covers
                   themes such as the use of visual rhetoric to change
                   public opinion, the evolution of sociology as an
                   academic practice, changing attitudes to physical
                   disorder, and the complexity of segregation as an
                   urban phenomenon. While the focus is on historical
                   maps, the narrative carries the discussion of the
                   spatial dimensions of social cartography forward to
                   the present day, showing how disciplines such as
                   public health, crime science, and urban planning,
                   chart spatial data in their current practice.
                   Containing examples of space syntax analysis
                   alongside full colour maps and photographs, this
                   volume will appeal to all those interested in the

  abstract =      {The urbanization of the world, which is one of the
                   most impressive facts of modern times, has wrought
                   profound changes in virtually every phase of social
                   life. The recency and rapidity of urbanization in the
                   United States accounts for the acuteness of our urban
                   problems and our lack of awareness of them. Despite
                   the dominance of urbanism in the modern world we
                   still lack a sociological definition of the city
                   which would take adequate account of the fact that
                   while the city is the characteristic locus of
                   urbanism, the urban mode of life is not confined to
                   cities. For sociological purpose a city is a
                   relatively large, dense, and permanent settlement of
                   heterogenous individuals. Large numbers account for
                   inidividual variability, the relative absence of
                   intimate personal acquaintanceship, the
                   segmentalization of human relations which are largely
                   anonymous, superficial, and transitory, and
                   associated characteristic. Density involves
                   diversification and specialization, the coincidence
                   of social relations, glaring contrasts, a complex
                   pattern of segregation, the predominance of formal
                   social control, and accentuated friction, among other
                   phenomena. Heterogeneity tends to break down rigid
                   social structures and to produce increased mobility,
                   instability, and insecurity, and the affilitation of
                   the individuals with a variety of intersecting and
                   tangential social groups with a high rate of
                   membership turnover. The pecuniary nexus tends to
                   displace personal relations, institutions tend to
                   cater to mass rather than to individual requirements.
                   The individual thus becomes effective only as he acts
                   through organized groups. The complicated phenomena
                   of urbanism may acquire unity and coherence if the
                   sociological analysis proceeds in the light of such a
                   body of theory. The empirical evidence concerning the
                   ecology, the social organization, and the social
                   psychology of the urban mode of life confirms the
                   fruitfulness of this approach.},

                   democracy. Democracy requires numbers for its proper
                   functioning, and there is now a large statistical
                   infrastructure of which the constitutionally mandated
                   census is the keystone. Mistrust of the government is
                   a major obstacle for the census, potentially
                   affecting both accuracy and completeness. The
                   mistrust is stimulated by fears of individual or
                   household census data being willingly or
                   inadvertently shared with other government agencies
                   (data privacy issues) or even foreign actors
                   (hacking). As two 2019 Supreme Court decisions in
                   juxtaposition suggest, no checks or balances protect
                   the integrity of the census. The professional
                   integrity of statisticians is the best defense of the

  abstract =      {The current fascination with urban life has
                   encouraged a growing interest in the 'Chicago School'
                   of sociology by students of sociological history. It
                   is generally accepted that the field research
                   practised by the Chicago sociologists during the
                   1920s - the 'Golden Age of Chicago sociology' - used
                   methods borrowed from anthropology. However, Rolf
                   Lindner also argues convincingly that the orientation
                   of urban research advocated by Robert Park, the key
                   figure in the Chicago School and himself a former
                   reporter, is ultimately indebted to the tradition of
                   urban reportage. The Reportage of Urban Culture goes
                   beyond a thorough reconstruction of the relationship
                   between journalism and sociology. It shows how the
                   figure of the city reporter at the turn of the
                   century represents a new way of looking at life, and
                   reflects a transformation in American culture, from
                   rejecting variety to embracing it.},

                   Labour of the People in London, published in
                   seventeen volumes between 1889 and 1903, was a
                   landmark in empirical social investigation. His
                   panorama of London life has dominated all subsequent
                   accounts: its scope, precision and detail make it an
                   unrivalled source for the period.Mr. Charles
                   Booth\&\#39;s Inquiry is the first systematic account
                   of the making of the survey, based upon an intensive
                   examination of the huge Booth archive. This contains
                   far more material than was eventually published, in
                   particular on women, work, religion, education,
                   housing and social relations, as well as on poverty.
                   While the book acknowledges the leading role of Booth
                   himself, it highlights the significance of the
                   contributions of his associates, including Beatrice

                   a founding text of both social history and modern
                   sociology. It has however commonly been misunderstood
                   and frequently misused. Mr. Charles Booth\&\#39;s
                   Inquiry sets the survey in perspective and
                   demonstrates the richness of the Booth archive and

                   among Europeans for the special attention they give
                   to the state of their population. In the first half
                   of the nineteenth century, as Paris doubled in size
                   and twice suffered the convulsions of popular
                   revolution, civic leaders looked with alarm at what
                   they deemed a dangerous population explosion. After
                   defeat in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, however,
                   the falling birthrate generated widespread fears of
                   cultural and national decline. In response,
                   legislators promoted larger families and the view
                   that a well-regulated family life was essential for
                   France.In this innovative work of cultural history,
                   Joshua Cole examines the course of French thinking
                   and policymaking on population issues from the 1780s
                   until the outbreak of the Great War. During these
                   decades increasingly sophisticated statistical
                   methods for describing and analyzing such topics as
                   fertility, family size, and longevity made new kinds
                   of aggregate knowledge available to social scientists
                   and government officials. Cole recounts how this
                   information heavily influenced the outcome of debates
                   over the scope and range of public welfare
                   legislation. In particular, as the fear of
                   depopulation grew, the state wielded statistical data
                   to justify increasing intervention in family life and
                   continued restrictions on the autonomy of
                   women.\textendash Mary Louise Roberts, Stanford

                   text in urban history, urban sociology, and urban
                   studies. Its innovative combination of ethnographic
                   observation and social science theory epitomized the
                   Chicago school of sociology. Robert E. Park, Ernest
                   W. Burgess, and their collaborators were among the
                   first to document the interplay between urban
                   individuals and larger social structures and
                   institutions, seeking patterns within the city's riot
                   of people, events, and influences. As sociologist
                   Robert J. Sampson notes in his new foreword, though
                   much has changed since The City was first published,
                   we can still benefit from its charge to explain where
                   and why individuals and social groups live as they
                   do.},

  abstract =      {For close to a century, researchers from across the
                   disciplines of Urban Studies have developed empirical
                   models for understanding the spatial extent and
                   social composition of urban neighborhoods\textendash
                   and how these dimensions change over time.
                   Unfortunately, however, these techniques have often
                   been developed within disciplinary silos and without
                   broad exposure to other potentially interested
                   constituencies. In this paper, we traverse the
                   literatures of social science, computer science, and
                   statistics to examine a variety of modeling
                   techniques for understanding neighborhood dynamics.
                   We begin our review by examining early concepts of
                   spatial structure first outlined in the Chicago
                   School and discuss how the notions of social ecology
                   and quantitative neighborhood analysis permeated the
                   urban studies for several decades to come. Our survey
                   continues by reviewing contemporary statistical
                   approaches for identifying urban neighborhoods,
                   culminating with the state of the art in subfields
                   known as `geodemographics' and `regionalization'.
                   Following this review, we offer insight into the
                   field's persistent conceptual issues, identify areas
                   ripe for additional research, and highlight
                   newly-developed computational methods that can inform
                   more just and socially equitable public policy,
                   community development, and accountable governance.},

  abstract =      {Activities which in any other context would be
                   described as direct marketing lie at the heart of
                   modern party political campaigning. Indeed, these
                   activities, and the targeting systems that drive
                   them, played a far more important role in the 2005
                   British general election than they did in any
                   previous one. In 2009, or thereabouts, their role is
                   likely to be even more important in determining who
                   gets to run the country. Yet despite the high
                   visibility of a general election campaign and the
                   implications of the election result on the ordinary
                   lives of direct marketing professionals, relatively
                   little is known in the direct marketing industry
                   about the extent to which political parties use the
                   segmentation practices which underlie the majority of
                   campaigns in the commercial sector. This paper seeks
                   to address this lack of understanding, using
                   interviews with communications managers in the three
                   main political parties supplemented by experience in
                   providing advice to two of the parties on information
                   strategy both before and during the election. In
                   particular it analyses differences between parties
                   and commercial advertisers in terms of the
                   environment within which they work; reviews the data
                   and data management practices that the parties
                   employed during the recent general election; provides
                   information on the parties' own evaluation of their
                   communications campaigns; and assesses how the use of
                   segmentation techniques is likely to evolve in
                   subsequent campaigns, for both Westminster and other
                   parliaments.},
