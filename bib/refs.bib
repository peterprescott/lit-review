  abstract = {Geographers are familiar with the difficulties encountered in the use of choropleth maps to represent census-type data, especially those associated with the modifiable areal unit problem. Here, an alternative, raster representation is suggested which seeks to recover some of the underlying distribution from population weighted centroids. These issues are considered, and found to be of great importance to any attempt to build a geographic information system for population-based data.}

  abstract = {Spatial data are collected and represented as attributes of spatial objects embedded in a plane. Basis change is defined as the transfer of attributes from one set of objects to another. Methods of basis change for socioeconomic data are reviewed and are seen to differ in the assumptions made in each about underlying density surfaces. These methods are extended to more general cases, and an illustration is provided by using Californian data. The implementation of this framework within a geographical information system is discussed.}
